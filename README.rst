Django Views - The Right Way
============================

An opinionated guide

Welcome! This is a documentation only project.

It is live on `spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way
<https://spookylukey.github.io/django-views-the-right-way/>`_.

Code examples are available in the `code <code/>`_ folder.

You can file an issue for typos, or something that you'd like to see covered
(but I don't promise to do it…)

If you have PRs for typos etc., it would be most useful if you could add changes
to the ``.rst`` files in the `source <source/>`_ folder. Thanks!
