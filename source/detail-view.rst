Displaying a single database object
===================================

To continue :doc:`our example <url-parameters>`, we want to display individual
product pages, looking them up from a product slug that will be part of the URL.

This requires knowing how to use ``QuerySet``, and in particular the
`QuerySet.get
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.get>`_
method. Assuming we have a ``Product`` model with a `SlugField
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/fields/#slugfield>`_ named
``slug``, the code looks like:

.. code-block:: python

   product = Product.objects.get(slug='some-product-slug')

However, this could throw a ``Product.DoesNotExist`` exception, which we need to
catch. Instead of crashing, we should instead show a 404 page to the user. We
can do this easily using Django's `Http404
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/views/#django.http.Http404>`_
exception.

The combined code would look like this:

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       product = Product.objects.get(slug=slug)
   except Product.DoesNotExist:
       raise Http404("Product not found.")


This is perfectly adequate code that you should not feel in any way embarrassed
about. However, this pattern comes up so often in Django apps that there is a
shortcut for it — `get_object_or_404
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/shortcuts/#get-object-or-404>`_.
This combines the above logic, so that you can just write:


.. code-block:: python

   # imports
   from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

   # in the view somewhere
   product = get_object_or_404(Product.objects.all(), slug=slug)

If the only thing we are going to do with the product object is render it in a
template, then the final, concise version of our view will look like this:

.. code-block:: python

   def product_detail(request, slug):
       return TemplateResponse(request, 'shop/product_detail.html', {
           'product': get_object_or_404(Product.objects.all(), slug=slug),
       })


That's it! Next up: :doc:`list-view`

.. _shortcuts-vs-mixins:

Discussion: Layering violations — shortcuts vs mixins
-----------------------------------------------------

``get_object_or_404`` is an example of a “shortcut” function. `Django's docs for
shortcut functions
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/shortcuts/>`_ defines them
like this:

    The package django.shortcuts collects helper functions and classes that
    “span” multiple levels of MVC. In other words, these functions/classes
    introduce controlled coupling for convenience’s sake.

And the `tutorial
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial03/#a-shortcut-get-object-or-404>`_
has a helpful comment about them:

    **Philosophy**

    Why do we use a helper function ``get_object_or_404()`` instead of
    automatically catching the ``ObjectDoesNotExist`` exceptions at a higher level,
    or having the model API raise ``Http404`` instead of ``ObjectDoesNotExist?``

    Because that would couple the model layer to the view layer. One of the
    foremost design goals of Django is to maintain loose coupling. Some
    controlled coupling is introduced in the ``django.shortcuts`` module.


An important property of well designed shortcut functions is that they only have
local effects on your code. For example, when we introduced
``get_object_or_404``, we replaced 4 lines in the original function and saved
some noise, but there were no effects on the external behaviour of that view
function, or on the interface of any function or method. If you want
“controlled” coupling that doesn't hurt your code base, this is vital.

(Some people think that the kind of coupling in ``get_object_or_404`` is always
unacceptable, but I think that's due to different expectations regarding
:ref:`service layers <service-layers>`.)

In a Django project, tell-tale signs of inappropriately coupled code would
include things like passing the ``request`` object around everywhere, especially
into the model layer, or code outside the view layer that returns HTTP responses
objects or generates HTML.

What about CBVs? I find it quite tricky to analyse these classes in terms of
“layering”.

We could look at the list of methods on a class like ``DetailView``, which
includes the following:

* ``dispatch``
* ``get``
* ``options``
* ``get_context_data``
* ``get_context_object_name``
* ``get_object``
* ``get_queryset``
* ``get_slug_field``
* ``get_template_names``
* ``http_method_not_allowed``
* ``render_to_response``
* ``setup``

These methods certainly span more than one layer. We've got methods that deal
very much with the HTTP layer (dispatching on different verbs, extracting data
out of a URL, building responses), and others that deal with retrieving database
objects and others with templates.

On the other hand, you could say the same about any view function. By their very
nature, views have to work in terms of HTTP requests and responses, but they
also have to arrange to get data from the database (or somewhere), and this CBV
is just a class-based equivalent to the view function.

Perhaps a better way to think about it is “the single responsibility principle” 
for class design. Through that lens, this class doesn't look very good at all. 
It has far too many different directions you might want to take it.

But the most convincing to me is to look at what happens when you carry on this
pattern.

I recently came across a family of views that had the following methods and
class attributes (including all the base classes):

* ``as_view``
* ``basic_styles``
* ``blue_font``
* ``cells_to_merge``
* ``check_token``
* ``columns_static_width``
* ``content_type``
* ``context_object_name``
* ``dispatch``
* ``empty_field``
* ``empty_row``
* ``extra_context``
* ``filename``
* ``freeze_panes``
* ``get``
* ``get_context_data``
* ``get_context_object_name``
* ``get_object``
* ``get_queryset``
* ``get_slug_field``
* ``get_template_names``
* ``http_method_names``
* ``http_method_not_allowed``
* ``merge_cells``
* ``model``
* ``options``
* ``pk_url_kwarg``
* ``pre_init``
* ``query_pk_and_slug``
* ``queryset``
* ``render_to_response``
* ``report_data``
* ``response_class``
* ``set_cell_style``
* ``set_header``
* ``set_rows``
* ``set_title``
* ``setup``
* ``sheet_names``
* ``slug_field``
* ``slug_url_kwarg``
* ``template_engine``
* ``template_name``
* ``template_name_field``
* ``template_name_suffix``
* ``thin_border``
* ``token_class``

These views generate Excel spreadsheets. For the methods you don't recognise,
most of them relate to XLS generation, or to retrieving data the from the
database. As you can guess, the implementation was significantly complicated by
the hybrid nature of this class. Methods like ``pre_init`` are trying to cope
with the lack of a sensible ``__init__`` that the developer was in control of.

It furthered suffered from the fact that all the methods had access to ``self``,
and therefore to the HTTP request object via ``self.request``. This meant there was
no clear separation of request processing from anything else — the layers had
all merged. This happens very easily with classes like this, because you never
have to explicitly pass the ``request`` parameter around to make it available,
it’s implicitly available via ``self``.

This kind of code is painful to work with even for the job it is doing. But when
new requirements come along — like you need to generate XLS reports offline,
outside of a web context — then you really are in a mess.

What is needed is a separate set of classes that handle just XLS generation,
which should then be used by our view functions (or classes). This will also
have the advantage of being able to test any aspect of the XLS generation
without having to set up a web request, or even necessarily getting data from
the database.

So where did the design go wrong? Look back at the views provided by Django, and
you'll see it is simply carrying on the same pattern.

This is a fundamental difference between a shortcut and a mixin. The shortcut is
a convenient way to reduce some boilerplate with only local effects on your
code, while mixins set up a pattern for your code which determines its structure
— and not in a good way. The coupling becomes totally out of control.

Brandon Rhodes has `an excellent discussion on mixins in his talk on Python
anti-patterns <https://youtu.be/S0No2zSJmks?t=3095>`_. He also specifically
calls out Django CBV mixins (though he manages to avoid saying ‘Django’), and in
my opinion his analysis is spot on.


.. _DetailView comparison:

Discussion: Comparison to DetailView
------------------------------------

If instead of my FBV above we had used `DetailView
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#detailview>`_,
what would the code look like? This is what I would write:

.. code-block:: python

   class ProductDetailView(DetailView):
       template_name = 'shop/product_detail.html'
       queryset = Product.objects.all()
       context_object_name = 'product'

We should also note that if our slug field on the model is not named ``slug``
then we will have to do extra configuration by adding ``slug_url_kwarg``.

This CBV is shorter, at least in terms of token count, than my version, although
not by much. It suffers from the common disadvantages that CBVs have, such as by
default not having an easy way to add extra data into the context, which makes a
big difference — put ``get_context_data()`` in and it’s longer again.

The essential logic that ``DetailView`` adds is equivalent to a single line in
my FBV::

  'product': get_object_or_404(Product.objects.all(), slug=slug),

For a mixin plus two lines of configuration, I don't think you are getting much
value for money.

You could make the CBV version more concise, but not in good ways. Each
alternative way to write this brings up some issues that I’ll discuss in turn.


Discussion: Convention vs configuration
---------------------------------------

The first way we could shorten the CBV version is by omitting ``template_name``.
The generic CBVs have some logic built in to derive a template name from the
model name and the type of view, which in this case would result in
``shop/product_detail.html``, on the assumption that the 'app' the model
lived in was called ``shop``.

This kind of behaviour is called “convention over configuration”. It’s popular
in Ruby on Rails, much less so in Python and Django, partly due to the fact that
it’s pretty much directly against the `Zen of Python
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ maxim “Explicit is better than
implicit”.

But it does appear in some parts of Django, and the `docs for DetailView
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#detailview>`_
encourage this particular shortcut. This is unfortunate, in my opinion, because
in this case convention over configuration seems great when you are writing the
code, and can be a nightmare when it comes to maintenance.

Consider the maintenance programmer who comes along and needs to make
modifications to a template. We do not assume a maintenance programmer is an
expert in your framework, or in this particular codebase. They may be a junior
developer, or they may be a more senior one who just has less experience in this
particular framework. (If you are not expecting your project is going to be
taken on by people like this, you really should).

They discover they need to change ``shop/product_detail.html``, and set
about looking for the corresponding view code. Where can they find it?

If we have used “convention over configuration”, they have to:

1. Know all the conventions that could end up referencing this template.

2. Look for any ``DetailView``, find the model it is using, and check to see if
   it matches ``shop.Product``. And also any further subclasses of
   ``DetailView`` etc.

3. In addition, they will have to do a grep for code that references
   ``shop/product_detail.html``, because as well as ``DetailView`` there
   could of course be other code just using the template directly.

Step 1 is especially problematic. Attempting to document all the conventions in
your code base probably won't do any good. If someone doesn't know the
conventions, they won't think to read docs, because unknown conventions are
unknown unknowns — they are like the surprising things in a foreign culture,
things that you don't know that you don't know until you trip up over them.

Step 2 is a bit annoying, and harder to do than a simple grep.

Finally, you still need to step 3 — which is the only step needed if you didn't
have “convention over configuration” to deal with.

So for both experts and people with less knowledge these typing-savers hurt
maintenance, and therefore hurt your project because most software development
is maintenance. If you do use CBVs, and even if you are convinced only experts
will be maintaining, and you are sticking to the naming convention, you will
still do yourself a favour if you always add ``template_name``.

The same “convention over configuration” logic is also present in the way
``DetailView`` looks up its object: it looks for a named URL parameter called
``pk``, and then one called ``slug`` if ``pk`` doesn't exist, and finds your
object using those parameters. Neat shortcuts, but leave a maintenance developer
completely stumped as to how or why this code works, or where you should start
if you want different behaviour. You have to read the docs in detail.

**On the other hand...**

Another example of “convention over configuration” in Django is that for every
model it will generate the table name it is going to use, which you can override
using ``Meta.db_table``. Similarly for the column names. Personally I think this
is much less problematic, for a number of reasons:

* Often, Django is able to manage the tables for you so completely that you
  don't even need to know the conventions.
* Most maintenance programmers are probably not going to be working their way
  back from SQL queries to find the code that triggers them. If they are, it is
  understanding how the ORM works, rather than code that can be grepped for
  table names, which is going to make their job possible.

Also, convention over configuration clearly has the upper hand in enforcing
consistency — the path of least resistance is that you use the convention. This
matters to the extent that consistency matters. For things that can “leak” and
eventually become difficult to change (e.g. names used in schemas) this can be a
crucial advantage.

To sum up: proponents of Ruby-on-Rail-style “convention over configuration” will
point to some super-verbose Java framework as an example of all the boilerplate
you can save. But this is a false dichotomy. With dynamic languages, very often
**we can choose exactly how much configuration we want to avoid**. We should
make sure we restrain ourselves if we are going to make code less maintainable
for the sake of saving a tiny bit of typing.

Discussion: Static vs dynamic
-----------------------------

For the case of statically defining what query to start with as class attributes
on the CBV, we have two options:

* ``model = Product``
* ``queryset = Product.objects.all()``

The former is a shortcut for the latter. I avoided it in my CBV version above
because it will hurt the maintenance programmer — if the requirements change
(for example to limit listed products to ‘visible’ products), starting with
``queryset`` will make it easy — it can just be changed to
``Product.objects.visible()`` or something similar.

For the same reason, in my FBV above I wrote
``get_object_or_404(Product.objects.all(), …)`` instead of
``get_object_or_404(Product, …)`` which is also supported by the shortcut
function.

If, however, the queryset needed depends on the ``request`` object, instead of a
static ``queryset`` attribute the programmer will have to define the
``get_queryset()`` method to get access to the request data and dynamically
respond to it. This is a different way of doing the same thing that they will
need to know about.

There is also a subtlety with querysets: suppose your
``ProductQuerySet.visible()`` method goes from being a simple filter on a field
to gaining some additional time based logic e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

   def visible(self):
       return self.filter(visible=True).exclude(visible_until__lt=date.today())

If you have ``queryset = Products.objects.visible()``, due to the fact that this
is a class attribute which gets executed at module import time, not when your
view is run, the ``date.today()`` call happens when your app starts up, not when
your view is called. So it seems to work, but you a get a surprise on the second
day in production!

None of these are massive issues — they are small bits of friction, but these
things do add up, and it happens that all of them are avoided by the way in
which FBVs are constructed.

**On the other hand...**

There are some benefits with the statically defined class attributes, in
addition to being more concise and declarative. For example, the Django admin
classes has attributes like ``fieldsets`` for the static case, with
``get_fieldsets()`` for the dynamic case. If you use the attribute, the Django
`checks framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/checks/>`_ is
able to check it for you before you even access the admin.

Some of the trade-offs here also depend on how often the static attribute is
enough, compared to how often you need the dynamic version.


Discussion: Generic code and variable names
-------------------------------------------

A third way to shorten the CBV is to omit ``context_object_name``. In that case,
instead of our ``Product`` object having the name ``product`` in the template,
it would have the name ``object``. Don't do that! ``object`` is a very bad
choice of name for something unless you really have no idea what type it is, and
it will hurt maintenance in various ways.

It’s good that the ``context_object_name`` configuration switch exists, but
unfortunate that it is optional. For the instance variable on the view, however,
things are worse — it is always ``self.object``. This is probably a good thing
when you are writing CBVs, but a bad thing when doing maintenance.

The issue here is again the problem of generic code. For the view code, it’s an
unusually tricky problem — you are inheriting from generic code that doesn't
know a better name than ``object``. However, **your** code is not generic, and
could have chosen a much better name, but your code isn't “in charge”.

This is a problem that is specific to **class based** generic code. If you write
:ref:`function based generic code <function-based-generic-views>`, the problem
doesn't exist, because you don't inherit local variable names.

We can think of this in terms of the “framework vs library” debate. Frameworks
impose a structure on your code, a mould that you have to fit into, where your
function gets called by the framework. In contrast, libraries leave you in
control, you choose to call the library functions in the structure you see fit.
Both have their place, but if we accept the constraints of a framework we should
be sure that it is worth it.
